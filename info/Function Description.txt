Function Description

1. Single Classification: 
Select a single image for classification, the image and result will be displayed on the middle pane, the displayed image will be shown in a resolution of 800x800, and the original image will not be modified. The program also automatically classifies and saves the result in the 'autosave_results.csv' file. Traverse images in the same folder using the Last/Next buttons above the displayed image. (Note: After manually selecting an image, the program will obtain a list of all the images in the same folder to prepare for the traverse, this can take a while if there are a lot of images in the folder.)
